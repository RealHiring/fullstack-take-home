# Take Home Exercise
You will have a week to complete the following take-home exercise. To submit your exercise, please email your code g-zipped to [sara@join-real.com](mailto:sara@join-real.com). Also please email with any questions you may have. Happy Coding!


## Exercise: Class Creator
Create an application that allows people to sign up for classes. Classes are structured in the following way: 

*  Each class has 4 sessions, and each session's content is released on a weekly basis. 

* A new section of the class is opened for sign up every 2 weeks.

* There is a cap of 10 people per class section.


## Requirements
* Javascript, Ruby on Rails, or Python preferred.

* All session titles and description should be viewable to users before sign up.

* A session's content should be viewable only by people who have signed up for the class. 

* The session's content should not be viewable until it's release date

### Bonus Requirements
* Only the section closest to its start date should be active for sign up until it is full. 
    * (i.e. if a class has a section starting January 1 and January 14, users can only sign up for January 1 until full).

* A user should only be able to sign up for 1 section of the class at a time.
